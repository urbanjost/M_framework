 Create large block letters
    
    These  routines  allow programs to create messages similar to the output of
    the Unix banner(1) command. These routines were used to create banner pages
    on  fixed  typeset  printers  and eye-readable frames in fiche in the past.
    They are currently primarily used in generating program start-up banners or
    attention-grabbing warning or error messages.
