================================================================================
M_FRAMEWORK DESIGN OPTIONS


unit testing versus test-to-failure, performance, scaling, stress, useability,
code conformance

================================================================================
RECURSIVE TESTING

call program and it calls itself with options to test stop or exit code functionality,
usually be calling program with something set like line environment variable or option
on command line.
================================================================================
INTERACTIVE MODE

possible call of M_matrix, interactive access to call the PID with tools like gdb,
small NAMELIST mode to pause and allow shell commands to be called, change level, 
and other NAMELIST variables. 
================================================================================
ONE PROCEDURE PER TEST PROGRAM OR ONE TEST PROGRAM

One file per procedure; works well with fpm and lets you selectively execute
by globbing file names; run with debugger on single file

single file is usually nice for build editing

tests internal to code creates a dependency but allows for testing private
procedures. If the build selectively removes the PRIVATE statement for special
test builds that is a work-around in most cases

built-in to programs as a confidence test if a subroutine is made instead of a program
a little program wrapper can run it but it can also be called by programs for new
installations to call.

================================================================================
Tools to compare files to results, examples showing using and(3f) and any(3f) with
almost(3f) to compare floating point arrays, tools for comparing graphics pixel maps,
maybe AI image recognition.

================================================================================
GENERATE TEST_SUITE FILE FROM FORTRAN SOURCECODE
How to generate:  something like splitf90 but lists names in modules and submodules
would be good. See also flower(1) for removing comments

compilers have extensions that help

scripts can leverage commands like nm, "gdb list functions", 

ifort -c -S --fcode-asm M_factor.f90
grep -- --- M_factor.code|grep -v '::.*:'
ifort -Fa *.f90
gprof
gcov
nm
ld -print-map -cref
objdump
readelf

================================================================================
SETTING MODES VIA PROCEDURE
call unix_check_mode(
cmdline=.true.,
interactive=.false.
)
================================================================================
COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

want a mode to not crack command line for use with programs that already use
command line

NAMELIST config files to set defaults 

================================================================================
LEVEL MEANING

array so can either pick max or if a specific value is present, any integer

================================================================================
COLORIZE OUTPUT

Whether to colorize output or not
================================================================================
CANDIDATES
Using with M_matrix
Using with M_graph
using with gdb

numeric diff tools like nd(1)/numdiff(1)

procedures that generate "nice" ranges like used for drawing axis to make a
list of test values, generate arrays of random numbers.
================================================================================
COMMAND output

call debuggers, call scripts to insert into SQLITE3 files, ...

seperate command for good and bad or recommend user-constructed goodbad(1) 
command.

options passed to command via string of options and/or namelist to stdin.
Used to call goodbad with many options passed to generate different outputs;
primarily to generate SQLITE3 file for generating reports from.

================================================================================
DIARY OR JOURNAL OUTPUT

Allow specifying filename(s) 

Select between stderr and stdout

namelist output that can be post-processed into reports.

multiple output formats like CSV version or XML or TOML/JSON?

LUNS or list of names (stderr, stdout, user filenames) as an array instead of
single output file via wrt(3f)

There is some kind of "test anything" standard output file proposed that other
tools can read. Not too familiar with it.
================================================================================
ENVIRONMENT

Show compiler version and options used

================================================================================
GENERAL

suitable for use with parallel code / thread safe?

object-oriented versus procedural versus functional programming

ease of use, documentation, built-in help, built-in generation 
of skeleton program, easy to remember or do you need to look up everything to 
use it?
